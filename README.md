Enhanced reset stylesheet for use with the Jatsby Framework

What's an "enhanced reset stylesheet?" Quite simply, it's a term we've coined to mean a reset stylesheet with a little something extra. For Rasa, that's global classes to easily apply common properties to elements (like "disabled" and "noselect").
